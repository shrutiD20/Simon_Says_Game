# Simon_Says_Game
Simon Says is a children's game where one player is Simon and gives instructions to the other players. The other players must only follow the instructions when Simon says "Simon says". If a player doesn't follow the instructions or does so incorrectly, they are eliminated from the game. The game continues until only one player is left.
